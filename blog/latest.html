        <p>A few weeks ago I set on trying out new WebGL 2.0 features with deck.gl. WebGL 2.0 brings plenty of new goodies to be used for game development, creative coding and data visualization like instancing, floating-point textures, transform feedback, multiple render targets, and more. With this in mind, and inspired by the work of Cameron Beccario, Viegas and Wattenberg and NASA I created a WebGL 2.0 wind map demo using deck.gl.</p>

        <p>We've just released a new major version of deck.gl, so this is a good time to share some information about the improvements that went into the new version, the rationale behind them, and some hints on what we are currently thinking about the future of deck.gl.</p>
